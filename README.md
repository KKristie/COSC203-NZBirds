# Birds Of Aotearoa

Birds of Aotearoa is a website I created for an assignment in order to grasp the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

It displays various facts about different New Zealand birds and allows you to apply different filters to search through the database of birds.




## Goals

🦜 Aesthetically display the birds of New Zealand. 

🔍 Create an easy-to-use search function.

🏳️ Highlight the conservation status of each bird.

🎓 Have fun while learning the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
